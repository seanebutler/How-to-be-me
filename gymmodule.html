		<h1>How to get a Good Workout at the Gym</h1>

		<img src="weights.jpg">

		<p>For me, working out is not something I feel like I'm obligated to do. Its something I really enjoy doing, and will keep doing as long as I'm physically able. During this summer, I've been spending alot of time in the gym. Here are some instructions on how I get a good gym workout.</p>

		<h2>Beforehand, you will need some materials to get the most out of your workout.<br>
		These materials include:</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>A water bottle</li>
			<li>Athletic clothing (shoes, shirt, shorts)</li>
			<li>A pre-workout formula</li>
			<li>Lifting gloves</li>
			<li>A towel</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Here are the steps that I take to ensure a good workout at the gym:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Take the pre-workout 30 minutes before beginning your workout.</li>
			<li>After you arrive at the gym, put everything in a locker except for your lifting gloves and water bottle.</li>
			<li>Put your lifting gloves on and fill water bottle if needed.</li>
			<li>Do whatever workout you have planned for that day. Use your towel to cover any benches or equipment you may sit or lay on.</li>
			<li>Make sure you stay fullly hydrated during your workout. Fill your water bottle if needed.</li>
			<li>When finished, go back to your locker and collect your things and leave. You're done!</li>
		</ol>
