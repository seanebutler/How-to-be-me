		<h1>How to Enjoy Water Country USA</h1>

		<img src="wcusa.png">

		<p>Water Country USA is a local water park located in Williamsburg, VA. My friends and I took visits here several times over the last 2 months, being that we have season's passes and to take advantage of the hot weather.</p>

		<h2>Beforehand, you will need some materials to have the best experience at Water Country USA.<br>
		These materials include:</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>A bathing suit</li>
			<li>A towel</li>
			<li>Flip-flops or sandals</li>
			<li>Money for food/locker</li>
			<li>Sunscreen/lotion if needed</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Here are the steps that I take to ensure a great experience at Water Country USA:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>When you arrive, apply sunscreen if needed.</li>
			<li>When you enter the park, head to the nearest locker station if you have valuables you dont wish to carry around with you, and purchase a locker and store your belongings.</li>
			<li>Go enjoy the park rides and attractions. If you get hungry, feel free to purchase some food. Make sure any belongings you keep with you are still with you as you travel throughout the park.</li>
			<li>When you are ready to leave, exit the park and use your towel to dry off. Hope you enjoyed your stay!</li>
		</ol>
