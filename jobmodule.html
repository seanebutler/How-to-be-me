		<h1>How to do Sean's Summer Job</h1>

		<img src="stocking.jpg">

		<p>After the Spring semester ended at Virginia Tech, I went home for a month and worked at a local grocery store to make some extra money. I was a grocery associate at said store. Below, are some instructions on how to perform this job.</p>

		<h2>Beforehand, you will need some materials to be able to do the job the best way.<br>
		These materials include:</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Grocery store uniform (green shirt, khaki pants, black shoes.</li>
			<li>A sharp boxcutter</li>
			<li>Strong hands and a lot of energy</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Here are the steps one must take on at my job every day:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Clock in at the computer.</li>
			<li>Head to the back of the store and begin breaking down the grocery truck delivery pallets.</li>
			<li>Take items off of pallets and place them on to carts according to what aisle the item goes on.</li>
			<li>Once there are no more carts available or all of the pallets have been broken down, take out a full cart to its respective aisle.</li>
			<li>Use the boxcutter or your hands to open cases on the cart and place the items on the shelves.</li>
			<li>Repeat steps 4-5 until there are no carts left.</li>
			<li>Clean up the backroom and fill up the sugar and water shelves.</li>
			<li>Ask the manager on duty if there is anything else that needs to be taken care of. If not, time to clock out at the computer, and you're done!</li>

		</ol>
