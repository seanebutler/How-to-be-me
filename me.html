		<h1>How to be Sean in the Summertime</h1>

		<img src="me.png"/>

		<p>My name is Sean Butler. I am a Computer Science major at Virginia Tech and this website is all about how to be me during the summer months. I'm 20 years old and a rising senior. During this summer, I've engaged in many activites, such as going to Water Country USA, working at a local grocery store, and going to the gym. Some modules on how to perform these activities are listed below.</p>
